In computer vision and deep learning, a blob is a binary large object, which is a chunk of data stored in a database or other storage system. 
In the context of your code, however, "blob" refers to a preprocessing step commonly used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
for computer vision tasks, such as object detection.


The blob is a modified and preprocessed version of the input image that is better suited for consumption by the YOLO (You Only Look Once) 
neural network. The modifications typically involve scaling pixel values, resizing the image to a specific spatial size, subtracting mean values, 
and potentially other operations like channel swapping.

This preprocessing is essential to ensure that the input image conforms to the expectations of the neural network. 
Different neural networks may have different requirements for input data, and preprocessing helps make sure that the input data is in a 
suitable format for the network to make accurate predictions.

In the case of YOLO, it often uses a fixed-size input image, and the blob is created with the specified spatial size (e.g., 416x416 pixels).
Additionally, the mean subtraction and channel swapping are applied to match the pre-processing steps used during the training of the YOLO model.
